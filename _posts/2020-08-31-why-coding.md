```
Because the only time I feel free in my life, when I code.

I may not be the smartest person and my whole life people have told me no, but coding was the only thing that accepted me.

It welcomes anyone with open arms, no matter who you are or where you're from.

All you need is a notepad and the world becomes your canvas.

And just like how coding shined a light in my darkest days and allowed me to be more open to the world.

I want to work here to help make the world become more open and connected.
